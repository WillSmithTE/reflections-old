When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

remote repositories are useful for sharing work. In a workplace withg multiple employees working on the same programs, it would be useful to be able to post all of your online for your employees to see (and change). Another good use is in community projects, as it allows random members of the community to view your code and potentially edit or add to it.
